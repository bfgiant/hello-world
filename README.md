# hello-world
The purpose of this repository is to learn how to use GitHub.

I want to learn how to use GitHub to keep track of the progress I am making on an ergonomic keyboard that I am designing the layout for. I think that commit messages will be a better way to comment on my progress than making lots of comments in my code files.
